WPILIFE
=======

A life service website For WPI Student   
http://wpilife.org    


###Attention:   
The theme of this website is bought here: http://themeforest.net/item/nevia-responsive-html5-template/3708895, and I am just taking and modifying the pages, which are useful for me.     
So, if you want to keep this theme, you'd better buy it. $15, it deserves, I think.   

###How to install:
**1. Database Import:**    
Setup database with wpilife.sql in `WPILIFE/DB_Scripts/` [Maybe out-of-date, and I will keep updating manually!]   

**2. Configure Database Connection:**   
Modify `application/config/database_Example.php` with your MySQL info, and rename it with `database.php`   

**3. Email SMTP**    
Modify `application/config/email_Example.php`, and rename it with `email.php`     
**Note**: you can use `sendgrid` or `mailgun` email sending service.  [I like the latter one]
