WPILIFE
=======

A life service website For WPI Student   
http://wpilife.org    

Project page: http://wpilife.github.io/WPILIFE/     

###Attention:   
The theme of this website is bought here: http://themeforest.net/item/nevia-responsive-html5-template/3708895, and I am just taking and modifying the pages, which are useful for me.     
So, if you want to keep this theme, you'd better buy it. $15, it deserves, I think.   

###How to install:
1. Setup database with wpilife.sql in `WPILIFE/DB_Scripts/` [Maybe out-of-date, and I will keep updating manually!]   
2. Modify `application/config/database_Example.php` with your MySQL info, and rename it with `database.php`     
3. Change line 69 in `/application/controllers/signup.php`, as now only the users with `wpi.edu` email can sign up    


###What will I do next
[x] Add vote page for singers     
[X] Add page for sponsors       
[ ] temporary house provide to live for new students       
[X] Add officers info      
[X] Add email template          
[X] Add Photo Module for WPILIFE so that new students can know WPI better          

###Note:
**Voting rules:**     
1. Each account can vote three times per day    
2. Each account cannot vote the same singer more than one time in the same day     
3. Singer can vote himself/herself
